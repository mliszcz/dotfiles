#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script is intended for sourcing bash files from the fish shell.
# It is run with bash and then executes into fish again (resulting in
# a new fish shell running as a subprocess). All exported environment
# variables will be available in the new shell but functions or other
# bash-specific constructs will not. Additionally fish_prompt will be
# updated if the bash script changes PS1.
# Example usage: source-bash ./activate-sdk.sh

# Clear PS1. Sourced script may prepend something.
PS1=""
source "$@"

# All PS1 must be remembered if we source multiple scripts.
# The original propmt from config file is restored on exec.
export _SOURCE_BASH_PS1="$PS1$_SOURCE_BASH_PS1"
